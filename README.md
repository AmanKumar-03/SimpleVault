# Simple Aptos Vault Smart Contract

## ðŸ“– Description
This project is a simple Aptos Move smart contract that allows users to create a personal token vault and deposit AptosCoins into it.  
The contract contains two primary functions:
1. **create_vault** â€“ Initializes a Vault resource for the user.
2. **deposit** â€“ Allows the user to deposit AptosCoins into their personal Vault, keeping track of the balance.

The vault is implemented as an on-chain resource linked to the user's account address, enabling them to store and manage their coins securely.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a simple yet powerful framework for users to manage their AptosCoin balances in a decentralized way using Move smart contracts.  
It serves as a fundamental building block for decentralized applications (dApps) on the Aptos blockchain, focusing on easy interaction, transparent storage, and secure asset management.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
This basic vault can be extended to support advanced features in the future, such as:
- Withdraw functionality to allow users to retrieve their deposited AptosCoins.
- Multi-user shared vaults or role-based access control for deposits and withdrawals.
- Integration with other dApps for decentralized finance (DeFi) services like staking, lending, or pooling.
- Event logging for deposit and withdrawal actions to improve transparency.
- Adding support for multiple coin types beyond AptosCoin.
